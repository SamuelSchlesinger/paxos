# Paxos

A mock implementation of Paxos along with a markdown presentation using
`slides` describing the algorithm.

The slides can be run like:

```bash
$ slides presentation.md
```

The code can be played with like:

```bash
$ ghci Paxos.hs
```

At some point, I would like to implement a working version of the algorithm
and try to understand the more practical considerations when building out
fault tolerant systems.
